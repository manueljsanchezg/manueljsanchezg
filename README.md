# üíª Web Developer

I'm Manuel J. S√°nchez, a **Software Engineering** student at the **University of Seville**. I'm currently focused mainly on web development, although I'm always open to exploring other areas like AI or Data Science.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies I work with:  
- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript (still learning...), Java, Python  
- **Frontend:** Vue.js and React  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express, Fastify), Spring Boot  
- **Databases & ORMs:** SQL, Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma  

My main goal is to keep learning and growing in software development so I can improve my skills and build personal projects that bring me value and experience.
